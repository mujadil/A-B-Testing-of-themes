# A/B Testing of Website Themes

## Overview

This project involves conducting A/B testing on different themes of a website to determine which theme performs better in terms of user engagement and conversion rates. We use statistical methods including p-value, t-statistics, and z-statistics to analyze the results and make data-driven decisions.

## Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/A-B-Testing-Themes.git
cd A-B-Testing-Themes

Install dependencies:
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the A/B test:
Use the provided scripts to load the data, conduct the statistical tests, and generate results:

bash

    python scripts/ab_testing.py

## Methodology
1. Data Collection

    Theme A and Theme B: Data is collected from user interactions with two different website themes. This includes metrics such as click-through rate, time on site, and conversion rate.

2. Hypothesis Testing

    Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the performance of Theme A and Theme B.
    Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference between the performance of Theme A and Theme B.

3. Statistical Tests
t-test

    Used when the sample size is small (typically n < 30) or when the population variance is unknown.
    Compares the means of the two groups (Theme A and Theme B).

z-test

    Used when the sample size is large (typically n â‰¥ 30) and the population variance is known.
    Compares the proportion of successes in the two groups.

Results

    Summary Statistics: Summary statistics of the key metrics for each theme.
    p-value Interpretation: The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (< 0.05) typically indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected.
    t-stats/z-stats: These values are compared against critical values from the t-distribution or z-distribution to determine statistical significance.

## Conclusion

Based on the results of the A/B testing, we determine Theme light performs better. The conclusion section summarizes the findings and provides recommendations for future testing or theme deployment.
